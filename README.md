## üõ°Ô∏è Usage

- **Single Check:**  
  Enter a username or email when prompted.  
  Output:  
  - `Account found boss` (account exists)  
  - `Account not found` (no linked account)  
  - `Error or blocked, try again` (rate-limited or error)

- **Bulk Check:**  
  Prepare a text file with one username/email per line.  
  Select bulk mode and provide the file path.  
  Each query will display a clear result for that input.

## üí° Advanced Usage & Best Practices

- **Proxy Rotation:**  
  Blocked or rate-limited? Add more proxies in `proxies.txt` to bypass restrictions and improve reliability.
- **Delay Configuration:**  
  Adjust the `request_delay` in the script for high-volume tasks to avoid bans.
- **No Logging:**  
  Script is privacy-friendly and does not store results unless you extend it.
